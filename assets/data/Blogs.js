          Consider how difficult it would be to begin each day with leaking
          pipes that were causing walls to collapse, causing mold and fungus to
          grow, and clogging sinks and toilets. These problems not only bother
          you and cause disruption to your daily activities, but they also pose
          a risk to your health. The importance of a good plumbing system is
          then apparent. It is essential to have a functioning plumbing system
          in order to live comfortably and stress-free. In this article from
          RAKtherm Ultimate Piping Solutions, we discuss the value of sound
          plumbing solutions and what to consider before installing your space
          plumbing system to prevent unpleasant surprises and problems.

          The best plumbing solutions are frequently those that you install once
          and then leave there alone. On the other side, a poor plumbing system
          only leads to problems. Therefore, investing in reliable plumbing
          systems is the easiest and most economical course of action. Regular
          maintenance is also necessary to avoid having to spend a lot of money
          in the future.

          The foundation of reliable drainage plumbing solutions is RNP
          technology. It is the most dependable and offers excellent levels of
          mechanical properties. It is one of the most creative methods
          available and provides a safe, leak-free, and permanent junction. The
          pipes homogeneous middle-layer construction is based on special cells
          to ensure increased mechanical resistance, wherein the inner-layer and
          outer-layer are combined forming like a “sandwich construction” that

          Exposure to UV rays can cause plastic pipes to become brittle and
          crack over time, reducing lifespan. Anti-UV piping systems are
          designed to resist the effects of UV radiation, which can extend their
          lifespan.

          textAlign={Platform.OS === "ios" ? "justify" : "left"}
        >
          Pipes that become brittle and crack due to UV exposure may need to be
          replaced, which can be costly. By using anti-UV piping systems, you
          can avoid the need for frequent replacements and reduce maintenance
          costs.

        >
          UV rays can also affect the safety of pipes used in specific
          applications, such as water distribution systems. When UV radiation
          breaks down the plastic, it can release harmful chemicals into the
          water supply. Anti-UV piping systems are designed to minimize this
          risk and ensure the water supply remains safe.

          Pipes exposed to UV radiation can also experience a performance loss

          NSHAMA Development LLC, a prominent real estate developer in Dubai,
          engaged Shapoorji Pallonji Mideast LLC to construct a new residential
          building of two parallel towers. The project faced a significant
          challenge in providing multiple expansion joints for the potable water
          line between the two buildings.

          The buildings' expansion and contraction due to temperature
          fluctuations and other factors necessitated expansion joints to
          prevent looping and potential damage to the water supply line. Mr.
          Sujan, the SPOC on RAKtherm's side, addressed this challenge.

          RAKtherm proposed a PPR U loop expansion system to tackle the problem.
          The solution involved inserting two PPR U loops (one each before and
          after the building joints) with a dimension of more than 2∆L for the
          width and a minimum length of 4∆L of the building expansion joint.

          As an alternative, RAKtherm suggested using SS or certified brass
          expansion joints. However, this option required cleaning and
          maintenance every six months due to the risk of bacteria buildup, dust
          accumulation, and potential blockage.

          By implementing the U loop expansion system, NSHAMA Development LLC
          achieved a cost reduction of 75K Dirhams, and the project was
          completed within the two-year timeframe. In addition, the solution
          ensured that the potable water line was installed correctly,
          maintaining a smooth operation as the buildings expanded and
          contracted.

          provided a cost-effective and efficient solution for the potable water
          line, ensuring an uninterrupted water supply for the building's
          residents.

          As a homeowner or property owner, keeping your plumbing system in good
          condition is crucial. Plumbing pipes can become old, worn, and
          outdated, leading to leaks, corrosion, and other issues.

          Replacing old plumbing pipes is often a wise decision to avoid costly
          repairs and ensure the safety of your home or property. This blog post
          will discuss why replacing old plumbing pipes is a good idea and how
          RAKtherm PPR piping systems can help.

          Old plumbing pipes, particularly those made of outdated materials like
          galvanized steel or copper, can be prone to leaks, rust, and
          corrosion. These issues can result in water damage, mold growth, and
          even health hazards, such as exposure to lead from older pipes.

          Replacing old plumbing pipes with newer, more durable materials like
          PPR pipes can prevent these issues and extend your plumbing system's
          life. Not to mention the added health benefits you get from PPR
          technology.

          RAKtherm PPR piping systems are an ideal replacement for old plumbing
          pipes. They are made from non-toxic, food-grade materials safe for
          human consumption and offer exceptional durability and longevity.

          In addition, RAKtherm PPR pipes are resistant to corrosion, scale, and
          chemicals, which makes them an excellent choice for use in harsh
          environments such as chemical plants, industrial facilities, and
          hospitals.

          Moreover, RAKtherm’s flagship PPR piping systems can withstand high
          temperatures and pressures, making them suitable for hot and cold
          water applications. In addition, they are easy to install, require
          minimal maintenance, and can be easily repaired without extensive
          excavation or replacement of the entire system. Here’s how:

          When it comes to efficient and effective plumbing, PPR (polypropylene
          random copolymer) pipes have become a popular alternative to metal
          pipes in recent years. In this blog, we will explore why RAKtherm PPR
          beats metal pipes in plumbing.

          One of the biggest advantages of RAKtherm PPR pipes is their
          durability. Our pipes are made by combining short and long hydrocarbon
          chains resulting in higher resistance to external damage. These pipes
          are also highly resistant to impact, corrosion, and chemical damage,
          making them ideal for use in a wide range of plumbing applications.
          Metal pipes, on the other hand, are susceptible to corrosion over
          time, which can lead to leaks and other plumbing problems.

          PPR pipes are highly versatile and can be used in a variety of
          plumbing applications. RAKtherm piping systems are designed to
          withstand temperatures of 0°C to 90°C, and short-term peak
          temperatures of up to 100°C with a service life of 50 years. They are
          available in a range of sizes and shapes and can be used in hot and
          cold-water systems.

          Another advantage of RAKtherm PPR pipes is their affordability. They
          are generally cheaper than metal pipes, making them a popular choice
          for plumbing projects on a budget. Additionally, PPR pipes require
          less maintenance than metal pipes, which can reduce long-term costs
          associated with plumbing.

          A network of pipes called an underground drainage system is made to
          move wastewater away from any residential, commercial, or industrial

          caused by it are prevented.
